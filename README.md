Future Awesome Playground
=========================

Greetings, web developers! Welcome to the Future Awesome Playground! Here you
can experiment with HTML, CSS, or other web technology and build the types of
web pages you hope to see online.

Edit away, and have fun!


Things to Note
--------------

This is not a typical Cloud9 workspace. Typically, a Cloud9 workspace is running
on a virtual server, and the website files and server software runs from that
server.

In this workspace, the `playground` folder actually exists on a different web
server, and we are just editing those files from Cloud9. This causes a few
differences:

- unlike most Cloud9 workspaces, you don't need to click "Run" to see your
  changes. Just edit, click save, and view the updated website at
  http://playground.futureawesome.us.
- the Preview does not work correctly. To see your changes, navigate directly to
  http://playground.futureawesome.us, or to the exact path, like
  http://playground.futureawesome.com/ben/about.html
