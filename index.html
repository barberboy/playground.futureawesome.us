        <h2>Welcome</h2>
        <p>
            Greetings, web developers! Welcome to the Future Awesome Playground! Here you can experiment with HTML, CSS, or other web technology and build the types of web pages you hope to see online.
        </p>
        <p>
            Edit away, and have fun!
        </p>

        <h2>Things to Note</h2>
        <p>
            This is not a typical Cloud9 workspace. Typically, a Cloud9 workspace is running on a virtual server, and the website files and server software runs from that server.
        </p>
        <p>

            In this workspace, the `playground` folder actually exists on a different web server, and we are just editing those files from Cloud9. This causes a few differences:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                unlike most Cloud9 workspaces, you don't need to click "Run" to see your changes. Just edit, click save, and view the updated website at
                <a href="http://playground.futureawesome.us">http://playground.futureawesome.us</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
                the Preview does not work correctly. To see your changes, navigate directly to
                <a href="http://playground.futureawesome.us">http://playground.futureawesome.us</a>, or to the exact path, like
                <a href="http://playground.futureawesome.us/ben/about.html">http://playground.futureawesome.com/ben/about.html</a>
            </li>
        </ul>
